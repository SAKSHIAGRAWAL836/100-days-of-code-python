# 🗺️ Day 3: Treasure Island Game

Welcome to Day 3 of my **#100DaysOfCodePython** challenge!  
Today, I created a fun and interactive **text-based adventure game** called **"Treasure Island"**, where the player navigates a short story in search of a hidden treasure. 🏴‍☠️✨

## 💻 Project Description

In this project, the player:
- Starts the journey by choosing between **left** or **right**.
- Then, picks a **door** to enter.
- Selects a **weapon**.
- Finally, chooses the **correct color** of the sword to unlock the treasure.

Each step involves decision-making that leads the player closer to victory or... *GAME OVER*. 🪦

## 🧠 What I Learned

- 📥 Handling **user inputs** and making the experience interactive.
- 🤔 Using **nested conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to create multi-level game logic.
- ✅ Basic input validation and comparisons using `or` conditions.
- 🎮 How to build **engaging CLI experiences** with ASCII art for better visual appeal.
